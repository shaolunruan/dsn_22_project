### Steps are shown here:
1. clone this project to your local directory
2. `cd` into project file
3. run `npm i`
4. run `npm start` to start dev this project


### Ways to configure params of the vis
1. modify `force` param to change the layout of the nodes
2. modify any color params to change the color scheme, just research any color codes (e.g., `#f0f0f0`)

Or, you can search all color codes with regular expression (e.g., `/#\w+/`)
